# Dungeon Master — Prompt Flow Overview

This repository powers Dungeon Master (a DM assistant). The diagram below shows how server-side prompts are loaded, rendered, injected, and used across campaign generation, background stages, character creation, and adventure (initial scene) generation.

Notes
- The canonical prompt templates are embedded in the Go binary from `go/internal/prompts/promptfiles/` (Mustache variables such as `{{campaignConcept}}`, `{{#factions}}...{{/factions}}`, or `{{languageInstruction}}`).
- Campaign generation is intentionally small and reliable; background stages expand the campaign and are persisted.
- Initial adventure generation injects DM-only rendered context from the persisted `campaignSpec` so adventures relate to the campaign background while starting naturally.

# Dungeon Master

Dungeon Master is a web-based application designed to deliver a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) experience, guided by an AI Dungeon Master. Players sign in with **Google**, games are **scoped to accounts** (with optional **invite links** for additional players in the same campaign). Utilizing cutting-edge AI language models such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, this platform offers a seamless integration of an AI Dungeon Master with an AI notetaker to craft an immersive narrative for games like Dungeons & Dragons.

The project originated from Cole Porter (Deck of DM Things on YouTube) and was supported by a dedicated Patreon community. When the project grew beyond the scope manageable by Cole, the decision was made to open-source Dungeon Master and discontinue the Patreon.

## Prerequisites

- **Go** (1.22+) to build and run `gmai-server` (`npm start` from the repository root). Optional **[Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)** for auto-rebuild: `go install github.com/air-verse/air@v1.52.3` (pin avoids newer Air requiring Go 1.25+), then `npm run dev` from the repo root (the script prepends `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` to `PATH` so `air` is found; watches `go/` and prompt `*.txt` under `go/internal/prompts/promptfiles/`). Use `@latest` if your toolchain is current.
- **Node.js** and **npm** for the Vue client (`client/dungeonmaster`) and tooling listed in the root `package.json`.

## Setting up External Dependencies

### .env File

For proper functioning of the application, you must set up the following environment variables:

#### MongoDB Atlas

- **Purpose**: Storing game save data and user accounts.
- **Setup**:
  1. Sign up or log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
  2. Create a new cluster and follow the setup guide.
  3. Retrieve your connection string by navigating to the 'Connect' section of your cluster.
  4. In your `.env` file, add `DM_MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string`.

#### OpenAI API

- **Purpose**: Interacting with AI models for generating and managing game content.
- **Setup**:
  1. Sign up for an account at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
  2. Generate an API key in the API section.
  3. In your `.env` file, add `DM_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key`.

#### Google Sign-In and session JWT (required for play)

- **Purpose**: Identify users, restrict `/api/game-state/*` and `/api/game-session/*` to members of each game, and support invites.
- **API** (`.env` in the repository root; copy from [`env.example`](env.example)):
  - `DM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` — Web application client ID from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (OAuth 2.0 Client IDs, type **Web**). Under that client, **Authorized JavaScript origins** must list the **exact** origin you use in the browser (scheme + host + port). Examples: `http://localhost:8080` and `http://127.0.0.1:8080` are **different** — add both if you switch. If this is wrong, the browser console shows `The given origin is not allowed for the given client ID` and requests to `accounts.google.com/gsi/button` return **403**.
  - `DM_JWT_SECRET` — Long random string used only to sign **app session JWTs** (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`). **Do not** reuse your Google OAuth **client secret** here.
- **Client** (`client/dungeonmaster/.env`; copy from [`client/dungeonmaster/env.example`](client/dungeonmaster/env.example)):
  - `VUE_APP_DM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` — Same value as `DM_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (the public Web client ID).

Optional: `DM_FRONTEND_URL`, `DM_CORS_ORIGINS`, and `DM_API_BASE` (client `main.js`) for non-default hosts (see env examples).

### Installation

1. Ensure that you have npm installed on your machine. If not, download and install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
2. In the project's root directory, execute `npm install` to install dependencies.
   - If you encounter any issues, such as permissions errors, consult the npm troubleshooting guide (https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/troubleshooting)

### Testing

- **Go API**: from `go/`, run `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/gmai-server`. CI runs the same on every push.

### Debugging LLM calls

- **Process logs**: set `DM_DEBUG_LLM=true` in `.env` and rebuild/restart `gmai-server`. Each call logs a short `llm-debug call …` line, then each request message on its own `llm-debug request msg[i]| …` lines (full body, newline-split, long lines chunked by runes—no `%q` ellipsis), then `llm-debug ok …` and the full assistant output on `llm-debug out| …` lines. Disable in production; prompts may contain user text and volume is high.
- **Persisted payloads**: `GameState` stores `rawModelRequest`, `rawModelOutput`, and timing/error fields (`llmCallStartedAt`, `llmCallCompletedAt`, `llmCallError`, …) for many flows. With a session JWT, `GET /api/game-state/debug/:gameId/prompts` returns those fields plus `campaignSpec` / `gameSetup` for inspection.

### Usage

To start Dungeon Master:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Copy [`env.example`](env.example) to `.env` in the repository root and configure MongoDB, JWT, Google client ID, etc.
3. Run `npm start` to run the **Go** API (`gmai-server`), or `npm run dev` if you use Air (restarts the server when Go sources or embedded prompt files change). For a local full stack (Vue dev server as a child process), set `DM_SPAWN_VUE_DEV=true` in `.env`. Otherwise run the client separately: `npm run client`.
4. Open your web browser at the URL shown (Vue dev server defaults to port 8080; the API defaults to port 5001 unless `PORT` is set).

You will be greeted with the Dungeon Master home page. Sign in with Google (after configuring OAuth origins), set a **player name** the first time, then use **New game** or **Load game** to play.
